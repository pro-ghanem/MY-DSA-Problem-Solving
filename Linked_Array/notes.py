'''

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers
>> the main goal of linked lists is to avoid the o(n) in arrays when  resizing and inserting or deleting an operations
>> there are 2 types of linked lists : singly and doubly linked lists :
>> the pros of singly linked-list :
- pros :
    - - linked-lists have constant time insertion and deletions in any position in comparison arrays require o(n)
     to do the same thing
    -- linked lists can continue to expand without having to specify their size ahead of time
- cons:
    to access an element in array u need to take n(k) time to go from the head of the list to the kth element.
    in contrast in array u have constant time operation to access an element in an array

>> diference between raise,try,assert :
raise - raise an exception.

assert - raise an exception if a given condition is (or isn't) true.

try - execute some code that might raise an exception, and if so, catch it.

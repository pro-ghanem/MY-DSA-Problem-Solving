In short, if you have data that doesnâ€™t use too many inserts or deletes, and access the items frequently out of order, use an array.
 If you need data that can be quickly inserted and deleted into and is accessed mostly in sequential order, use a linked list.
 If you need a fast traversal then a hash table with a good hash function will be a better choice.

>> hashTable used when : (traversing) I have a key for each element and I don't know the index of the element into an array,
 hashtables perform better than arrays (O(1) vs O(n)).

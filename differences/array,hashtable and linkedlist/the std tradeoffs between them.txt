The standard trade offs between these data structures apply.

Binary Trees
medium complexity to implement (assuming you can't get them from a library)
inserts are O(logN)
lookups are O(logN)
Linked lists (unsorted)
low complexity to implement
inserts are O(1)
lookups are O(N)
Hash tables
high complexity to implement
inserts are O(1) on average
lookups are O(1) on average
